# Servicely: A web-portal for matching services with volunteers and the needful
​
## Project Description
People often themselves in situations where they feel like helping out or where they are in a tight spot and need help. This web-application is intended to help users in both these situations. It allows a user to select whether they would like to offer help (by donating to a charity or volunteering at an organization) or if they are looking for help (for example employment or health services).
