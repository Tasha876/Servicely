## 1. Description
This app (currently) displays charity information depending on the users location. If the user has geolocation enabled in their browser and wishes to share their location, then the location is entered automatically. Should this not be the case, a modal box appears asking the user to enter their city and state-code. 

### Note:
The particular functionality of entering the city and state-code does not work for users located outside of the United States. The geolocation functionality appears to work for at least certian areas in Canada as well as in the US.

### APIs Used:
APIs used include:
1. OrgHunter API for charities in the user's area
1. Wikipedia API for charity descriptions (will change if incorrect)
